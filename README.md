# OOPS Library

> Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that you will create will allow you to:
> - Add new students or teachers.
> - Add new books.
> - Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
>  And all of this will be acheivable in a beautiful and well-organized way with this project!
